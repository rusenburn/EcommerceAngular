# Ecommerce Angular

this is the Angular GUI for my [.NET5 Ecommerce](https://github.com/rusenburn/Ecommerce_Djackets_ASPNET5) site

## Configurations
You can configure it by modifing ./src/app/app.config.json file , However, a server restart is needed though.

## Restore
Run `npm install` to restore all project dependecies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
